Objective: The project aims to address the increasing bounce rate in a healthcare organization, leading to patient dissatisfaction. The primary goal is to minimize the bounce rate by at least 30% while reducing inventory costs, with an expected revenue increase of at least 20 lacs INR. Utilizing a Data Analytics Project Management Methodology, the project will handle a dataset of 14,218 rows and 14 columns, focusing on the Supply Chain Management department.

Code Summary: The project involves two main phases: data pre-processing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
